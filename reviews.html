        <div>"I highly recommend getting bike work done by DJ Cycles, Dave went over the fork tubes and took his time sanding out the rock chips and a crosshatch scuff with fine sandpaper to insure the seals last as long as possible. Another satisfied customer."</div>

        <div>"Couldn't be happier using Dave for some cooling problems on my bike. More thank reasonable prices, made arrangements for me to drop off my bike at my convenience, and a super cool guy to deal with."</div>

        <div>"I recently purchased a 05 SV650 and wanted to get an overall safety inspection, so I gave Dave a call. He was even able to have a look at my bike that same day (a Saturday no less). Dave was very personable and was willing to walk me through all of the what to check and why, and how to adjust if necessary. He also answered all the other numerous n00b questions I threw at him. I left there knowing that the bike was mechanically safe, and with the know-how to check and adjust some of the things myself in the future. Thanks again, Dave!"</div>
