      <h3>Welcome to DJ Cycles!</h3>
      <img class="rightimg" src="img/topimg_03.jpg" width="300"/>
      <p>DJ Cycles is a highly regarded motorcycle repair shop in the South Bay, specializing in Japanese and European bikes.  Owner Dave Jenks provides factory-trained technical skill, honesty, and fair pricing, which has earned his shop a loyal following of local riders.

      <p>Because of the size of DJ's operation, he can be competitive on labor costs. You will receive the same quality of service as shops in the area, without the high prices.  With a long history in repair, and a personal touch that builds a great relationship with each customer, Dave's reputation is well earned.</p>

      <p>DJ is an avid rider as well, and participates in many local rides.  When he's not turning a
        wrench, you can usually find him out on the trail or enjoying some of the great South
        Bay roads that are right in his back yard.</p>
      <p>Hope to see you soon!</p>

    <div>"I recently purchased a 2005 SV650 and wanted to get an overall safety inspection, so I gave Dave a call. He was able to have a look at my bike that same day (a Saturday no less). Dave was very personable and was willing to walk me through all of the what to check and why, and how to adjust if necessary. He also answered all the other numerous n00b questions I threw at him. I left there knowing that the bike was mechanically safe, and with the know-how to check and adjust some of the things myself in the future. Thanks again, Dave!"</div>
