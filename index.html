      <h3>Welcome to DJ Cycles!</h3>
      <img class="rightimg" src="img/topimg_03.jpg" width="300"/>
      <p>DJ Cycles is a new motorcycle shop in the South Bay. For the past 6 years, DJ has worked as a mechanic at Honda Peninsula Ducati Kawasaki KTM. 
        He is both Honda and Ducati factory certified. DJ also worked as a mechanic for Grand Prix 
        Kawasaki Suzuki Yamaha.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, while DJ specializes in Japanese and Ducati motorcycles, he is able to work on everything. If it has two wheels and a motor, bring it by!</p>
      <p>Because of the size of DJ's operation, he can be competitive on labor costs. You will receive the same quality of service as shops in the area, without the high prices.</p>
      <p>DJ is an avid rider as well, and participates in many local rides.  When he's not turning a 
        wrench, you can usually find him either out on the trail, or enjoying some of the great South
        Bay roads that are right in his back yard.</p>
      <p>Hope to see you soon!</p>

    <div>"I recently purchased a 2005 SV650 and wanted to get an overall safety inspection, so I gave Dave a call. He was able to have a look at my bike that same day (a Saturday no less). Dave was very personable and was willing to walk me through all of the what to check and why, and how to adjust if necessary. He also answered all the other numerous n00b questions I threw at him. I left there knowing that the bike was mechanically safe, and with the know-how to check and adjust some of the things myself in the future. Thanks again, Dave!"</div>
